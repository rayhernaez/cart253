## Description

A playful self-portrait built with p5.js. Drag the **cookie** or the **spider** to my face to change my expression. The eyes follow your mouse.

### Controls & Interaction

- Click & drag the cookie or the spider.
- Cookie on my head → I smile.
- Spider on my head → I'm sad.
- My eyes follow your mouse!

## New p5 functions I tried

- **translate()** is used to move the spider (legs + body).
- **vertex(), bezierVertex(), quadtraticVertex(), arc()** is used to draw curve lines and cut ellipses.
