## Description

A mini p5.js game that is a modified version of [frogfrogfrog](https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/making/examples/frogfrogfrog.zip). Froggy is the new Avatar (inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender) and he can bend all 4 elements (Water, Earth, Fire, Air). Bugs are swarming down to his beloved pond. Use elemental attacks to stop them! There are 15 bugs in total. Each kill changes the sky colour which transitions from day to night.

### Controls & Interaction

- Click mouse to attack
    - Hit a bug twice to defeat them

    - A = Air 💨 (against Yellow Bugs 🐝)
    
### Win/Fail
