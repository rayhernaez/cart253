**1. Frog is a picky eater**
- lots of different bugs species flying around
- it only craves a specific bug
- the bug it craves changes after it eats its previous craving

2. Frog has another way of eating
- it might not need its tongue to eat
- it might just use its open mouth and inhale the bugs in

3. Frog is sick and spits out flies
- frog ate too much flies and is nauseous
- it vomits them out
- help the frog vomit all the flies out of its system

**4. Frog pushes flies away with its tongue**
- frog hates flies
- flies always tease it and fly around it
- frog uses its tongue to punch them away

5. Frog's tongue gets larger as it eats flies
- it's a hard start with a very thin tongue
- tongue gets larger as it eats (maybe 3x flies)

**6. Frog is a mother who proects her babies**
- same idea with pushing away the flies
- flies are evil who are pestering the family
- the babies are visible with the mommy frog

7. Frog shouts away the flies
- instead of tongue, it yells away the flies

**8. Frog is the new avatar**
- concept from the avatar: the last air bender
- instead of tongue, it spits elemental powers (fire, water, air, earth?)
- flies are evil villains that are against the avatar
- flies have their own element types
- water attacks are effective against fire flies (for example), etc

9. Frog is a police officer catching fly criminals
- frog has to catch all the fly criminals flying away

10. Frog has multiple tongues
- again with new ways to eat
- 3 tongues would stretch out in a cone shape

11. Frog sings and attracts flies
- frog is the big star on stage
- flies are its fans

12. Frog has to collect flies around so much debris floating around
- frog must eat flies and avoid eating floating debris

13. Flies drop bombs
- frog must avoid the bombs to survive

14. Flies evolve overtime
- if not eaten within a time limit, flies evolve and become harder to eat

15. Flies eat the frog
- avoid the flies at all cost!

**16. Frog has eyes**
- its eyes follow the flies or the mouse

17. Frog evolves as it eats more and more
- frog evolves physically and skillfully

18. Frog gain more abilities as it eats
