Kerven shows a project that feels playful but also intense. The readme is a bit lacking and could say more about what the project is about and how to interact with it. There's at least a short description and a link to play the game. The menu looks great with a cartoon vibe to it. The fonts are fun and the clouds move in a soft subtle way. Buttons react on mouse hover which is a great touch. It was a bit odd that the initial load of the game is silent, but then the music starts as the menus change. The core loop is tense in a good way. The game over screen really hits hard on me because the sound gives off this feeling of getting caught, which I guess is the whole point. Navigation is clear with restart and return to menu options. The code looks clean and organized with comments. Many variables are declared at the top without values. I think it would be better to give each a default value or undefined, or even put a short comment of the plan for them.

Kai delivers a fun project. The readme gives a strong overview with screenshots, insctructions and credits which makes it descriptive and user-friendly. The dialogue is funny which adds personality. The menu shapes move away and sometimes dodge the cursor so clicking was not easy. Cannon shots sound heavy and really enforces the whole pirate concept. The pills act like powerups and change cannon ball size or speed, which make the gameplay different and active. The goal is not fully clear though. Does the game end or is it a survive-as-long-as-possible loop that stops when 20 flies are missed? A short line on the start screen or in the readme would help. Visual style could be pushed more. I think better fly drawings, a background, and layered sounds would enhance the whole aesthetics. The code is neat. Objects are used across the file and functions do single things. Comments are detailed and the structure is easy to follow.

# Lanna Check

Lanna shows the most complete experience of the 3. The readme is very descriptive with instructions, screenshots, attributions, and a clear list of changes from the base project. Sound is almost everywhere throughout gameplay and gives steady feedback. The flies have variety and the potion mechanic is brilliant. Tips and dialogue boxes guide the player so it feels very user-friendly. The hunger meter works really well. The tongue shortens as the meter drops which depicts the frog getting less and less energy. It becomes really challenging at that point. The warning sound near empty of the meter adds tension to the experience. Not sure about the winning condition. Is it endless until you fail? The art is really cute and consistent. The calm music in the background balances the stress that I felt. The code is clean with comments and lot sof conditionals, which give functional interactivity of the game. Some variables are declared without values, and maybe putting undefined as placeholder would be better practice moving forward.
