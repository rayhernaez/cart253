Jeany's portrait has a sophisticated stare that reads as "I don't care what you think" vibe. The basic Windows style desktop behind it feels nostalgic, and each mouse click gives an error sound that tells me to stop clicking. That tension makes the face even more judging about the very act of interaction. The slow floating clouds is a good touch and soften the scene. The overall aesthetics of the background and the portrait strengthens the combination of technology and artistry. In the code, emojis are used in a clever way and the resizing places them neatly in the canvas. The different shapes and images keep it flexible. However, formatting could be better. Consistent spacing and indentation would help with readability. I find some comments funny, though in a professional context clearer terms would read betetr. A short comment description above each function would add clarity as well.

Kerven's portrait keeps things simple. A head is at the centre of the canvas and the eyes follow a red dot. I like how the shapes are put together to create a cartoon-looking head. The bored expression matches the straight-to-the-point layout. Nothing extra happens when clicking or dragging, so the experience becomes about what I see rather than what I do. That can work, but a quick note in the page or the README file that says how to interact on the work would be a good idea. The code looks clean and indentation is good. The title and author name at top comment on the script need to be modified however. Many areas are missing comments. A few comments above variables and functions would greatly help in understanding how they work. The red dot could mean as the person's favourite colour or something they find boring. It's all in the user's interpretation.

Kai's portrait stares right at me, deep within my soul. The clock in the back spins endlessly. Dragging across the shirt using the mouse shows ribs, which makes me think of the concept of death. The theme works because each mechanic are put together for a reason. It feels the most layered work out of the three. The code is long, which makes sense because of the amount of things happening in the work. Comments are present and very helpful. I would have liked to see some comments above the conditionals. Variables are also everywhere. Grouping them at the top would clean the structure. The experience feels good overall. The coding matches the intent of teh work. It speaks about anxiety, death and time in a direct and memorable way.
